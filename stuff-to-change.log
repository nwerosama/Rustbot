Only things that are needing to be changed before deploying this template to real-world use;
- The project name (Rustbot)
- Dockerfile image tag and its service in compose file
- events (rustbot_events), and its references
- jobs (rustbot_jobs), and its references
- library (rustbot_lib), and its references
- tsclient (rustbot_tokens), and its references

Search by Rustbot in its usual form (all-caps, pascalcase, and such) to find all the references that need to be changed too.

(and delete this file too!)
